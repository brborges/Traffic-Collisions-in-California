## Traffic Collisions in California 2010-2020

This document aims to conduct an exploratory analysis on traffic collisions in the state of California over the last decade.

The main objectives of this analysis are:

1) To determine the percentage of collisions resulting in injuries versus those that do not result in injuries over time.
2) To determine the percentage of the main collision factors over time.
3) To calculate the average number of collisions per day of the week (Monday to Sunday).
4) To create a map showing the average number of crashes by injuries severity.
5) To build a classification model to predict whether a collision will result in injuries.

## About the dataset

The [Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS)](https://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/index.jsp) is a database maintained by the State of California that contains information on traffic collisions.

The data is used extensively for various purposes, such as identifying when automobiles, motorcycles, and bicycles crash, quantifying the risks associated with daylight saving time, and providing other statistics on collisions in the state.
